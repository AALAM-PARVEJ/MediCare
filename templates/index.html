    <h2>BE YOUR OWN DOCTOR</h2>
    <p>
      It might have happened so many times that you or someone needs your doctor’s help immediately,
      but they are not available due to some reasons. The disease prediction system is an end-user
      support and online consultation project. Here, we propose a web application that allows users
      to get instant guidance on their disease through an intelligent system. The application is fed
      with various details and the disease associated with those details; the application allows
      users to share their disease related issues. It then processes user specific details to check
      for various illness that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent data mining
      techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s details.
      Based on result, patient can contact Doctor accordingly for further treatment.
